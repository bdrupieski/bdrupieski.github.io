I am a software engineer currently living and working near Baltimore Maryland. This is my personal technical blog. 

To see some of my code visit my GitHub profile [here](https://github.com/bdrupieski). Unfortunately most of what I work on is closed source so this currently only contains some things I work on in my free time.
