I am a software engineer currently working at a healthcare IT company near Baltimore Maryland. This is my personal technical blog. 

I've just started, but I hope to post not infrequently on new technologies I'm learning or technical issues I'm currently facing.

To see some of my code visit my github profile [here](https://github.com/bdrupieski). Unfortunately most of what I work on is closed source so this currently only contains some things I work on in my free time.
